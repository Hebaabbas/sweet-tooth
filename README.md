## Features:
Here i will explain briefly of the contents of the website and how it will help the users with what they're looking for.

### Logo
The first thing the user will see is the big logo, i picked a picture to attract the users attention to one of the sorts that are sold in the shop; cupcakes. I also added a text on the logo to give the users a good expectation to the shop.

### Navigation bar
In the website there is a navigation bar, the user can click on the section of interest and the website will reach to that point of section. I wanted to make it extra nice so i used some Java code to make the menu bar sticky in the website.

### Features Left to Implement
None, i have implemented all the features i had planned to implement.

## Testing
The testing part has been the most one taking time as i was testing the website every time i add or change code. Testing that all content of the website fit perfectly and nicely in the web page, that it looks nice on all screen sizes, and that the subscribtion parts works great and leads the user to another page which gives the thank you page.

I mostly had many issues with fixing that the screen fits in all screen sizes, but reading through more and searching more i had finally been able to reach the part i was trying to reach. 

The new page which gives the "Thank you for subscribing text" has no problems, the only thing to point out is that once the user clicks on sumbit then the user will get an error message page, the user has to just refresh the page.

It also took a long time for me to make it nicer with a sticky nav menu. I wanted to make it easier and nicer for the user so i did an additional extra implement to the website and make the navigation menu sticky by the help of JavaScript.

## Validator testing:
HTML : No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator

CSS : No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

## Unfixed bugs:
There are no unfixed bugs left to be fixed in the website.

# Deployment:
This section is to describe the process of deploying the website on Github:

First, In the GitHub repository, I navigated to the Settings tab, then i have selected the pages options from the setting tab options and have selected the Main Branch.
